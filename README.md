# Login Page Project

## Project Overview
This project consists of a simple login page built using HTML and styled with Tailwind CSS. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to input their username and password. The form is designed to submit the login details to a server-side endpoint (`/login`) using the POST method.

## Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Open the `login.html` file**:
    You can either open it directly in your web browser or set up a local server for a better testing environment.

3. **Use a local server** (optional):
   If you want to run the project in a local server environment, you can use tools like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for Visual Studio Code or [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) for Node.js.

   Example using `http-server`:
   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   http-server .
   ```

## Usage
1. Open your web browser and navigate to the location of the `login.html` file.
2. Enter your username and password into the respective fields.
3. Click the "Login" button to submit the form.
4. If there are any errors (e.g., invalid username or password), an error message will be displayed below the login form.

## Features
- Simple and clean user interface.
- Form validation for username and password fields.
- Error message display when login credentials are invalid.

## Dependencies
This project relies on [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling, which is included via CDN in the HTML file.
